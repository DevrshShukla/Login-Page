# Login-Page
This image showcases a login page that has been crafted using HTML and CSS, viewed on a local server. The design features a clean and modern aesthetic with a dark blue background that gives a professional look to the interface.

At the center of the page, there's a prominent login form, enclosed within a light gray, slightly rounded rectangular container. The container creates a subtle contrast with the dark background, making it easy for users to focus on the login form.

The form includes fields for the username and password, each with a placeholder respectively. These fields are aligned horizontally and labeled clearly, ensuring users understand what information needs to be entered. The labels are bolded and left-aligned to maintain consistency and readability.

Beneath the input fields, there are two helpful links: "Forget Password!" and "Sign up." These links are essential for users who may need to recover their password or create a new account. 

The "Login In" button is prominently displayed at the bottom of the form. The button is styled with a rounded shape and matches the color scheme of the login container. Its size and placement make it the focal point, encouraging users to complete the login process.
